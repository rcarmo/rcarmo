## Hello World

I'm a deeply technical guy, currently Principal Architect at Azure for Operators (back in the telco low-level, high-performance, 5G/Edge/PMEC bleeding edge) after around 20 years of work in the telco/internet industry (where I did just about everything from network planning to mass-market product development) and 6 years doing Azure and cloud-native data elsewhere in Microsoft.

I've been blogging about technology in general (but mostly about Macs) at [Tao of Mac](https://taoofmac.com) since 2002, and have [a little portfolio site](https://carmo.io) with more info. 

Make sure you also visit [Insightful Systems](https://github.com/insightfulsystems) and [Piku](https://github.com/piku) while you're here.
